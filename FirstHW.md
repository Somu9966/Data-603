# Summary of Data Lakehouse
The Databricks article introduces the concept of a "data lake house" which uses a hybrid technique that combines the most advantageous areas like data lakes and data warehouses. It promotes the use of a data lake as a base storage layer for housing raw, unstructured data and further applying structured processing, governance, and schema-on-read capabilities. This approach aims to decrease the gap between data engineering and data science by providing a single platform for data storage, processing, and analytics. It achieves this while using open standards like Delta Lake, facilitating seamless data management.

In conclusion, this article throws light on new age data management strategies, enabling organizations to make well-informed decisions regarding their data infrastructure.
